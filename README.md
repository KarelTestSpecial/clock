A simple, clean, and highly customizable clock that opens in a minimal window. Designed to be practical and easy on the eyes, it provides the information you need with a host of personalization options.

## Usage

Click the clock icon in your browser's toolbar to open the clock window. Clicking the icon again will close it.

## Features

- **Clear Digital Clock:** A large, easy-to-read digital clock is the centerpiece of the extension.
- **Date and Battery Status:** Displays the current date and your device's remaining battery percentage.
